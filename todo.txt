Todo: 

Restart with base HTM implementation. Clearly test and demonstrate confidence metrics. Test different combinations of numerator/denomenator
to come up with most salient metric by which to modulate learning signal

Test base HTM with different sequence length, catastrophic forgetting sequence, noise robustness, etc all with parameterization sweeps
to best understand the limitations and where the system needs to be improved (and where it *can* be improved)

Record data about number of active neurons, number of predicted neurons, number of bursting columns, number of active but not predicted,
number of active and predicted, number of predicted but not active. 

Determine how best to gauge *accuracy*(does this encoding match other encodings of similar inputs?) and *stability* (does it still match
after other sequences have been learned?)
